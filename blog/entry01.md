The Freedom Project is all about helping us learn more about the things we might want to do in the future, and it gave me a chance to really explore different career paths that interest me. I picked criminal law as my top choice, with bomb technician as my second option, and police officer as my third. Looking into each of these helped me understand what kind of work they involve, what kind of lifestyle they come with, and what I might need to do to prepare for them. One thing that’s exciting is that we’ll have opportunities like internships where I can build skills and get real-life experience that will help me in whatever career I end up choosing.

I chose to focus on criminal law because I like the idea of standing up for justice and helping people through legal work Criminal lawyers get to work on important cases ive also always watched suits so that really gotinto it and this will be my long term project i will be working on, represent clients, and really make a difference in their communities. According to LawCrossing, being a criminal lawyer can be both challenging and rewarding, with the chance to grow your skills over time and even earn a good salary as you gain experience (LawCrossing). I also thought being a bomb technician sounded really cool because it’s a high-stakes job that involves protecting people and working with technology. The ATF explains that bomb techs go through a lot of training and play an important role in keeping communities safe (ATF.gov). Lastly, being a police officer would also let me help people directly, deal with different situations every day, and be part of a team. All three careers are about protecting and helping others, but criminal law really stood out to me as the path I want to follow.This topic is also very asscoited with technology as they used printer and have to look up files get things right and to find info that might help them in thier legal case the reason i really lock in this choise was due to being more realistic as my parents would not approve of such thoughts of jobs that include life risk and this seem the one to be very high paying and can even vary.
